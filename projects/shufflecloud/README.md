# What's this?
A SoundCloud player that properly shuffles the songs in a given playlist.

# What's wrong with SoundCloud's shuffle?
It randomizes only the songs that are loaded in the webpage, which is very annoying
in playlists with hundreds of songs. In order to shuffle the playlist properly, you
have to scroll down until the end to load all the songs, then play the first song.
Even then, it doesn't feel random enough (works perfectly fine on the mobile app
for some reason). So, unlike SoundCloud, ShuffleCloud will make sure that every song in any
playlist does not feel left out.
